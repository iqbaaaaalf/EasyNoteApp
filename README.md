# EasyNoteApp

```
Simple Note App just for implementing what i've learn so far
```
## What i used in this project

* **Kotlin** as a Primary Language
* **MVVM** Design Pattern
* **Room** as ORM for SQLite Data Persistence
* **LiveData** for Observe data changes

## Current State of This Project ##

* Only display a list of note and have a function to add a notes with default notes data.

## Next move ##
1. fix DateConverter so the app can store createDate and dueDate data in SQLite
2. create "Add Note" Activity and OnClick functionality in each note

## P.S : tell me your opinion about this project
```
so i can learn more about new things in Android Development
